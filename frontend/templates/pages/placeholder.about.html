					In the course of any NLP application development, there are many basic steps which are common across
all NLP tools. These may be as basic as tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and extend to as
complex tools as Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation etc. <br>
As different teams within an enterprise look at developing their own NLP applications, the initial parts of
all their pipelines have same building blocks like sentence tokenizers, word tokenizers, NERs, parsers etc.
Further, as we get deeper into these pipelines, we see complex tools: like sentiment analysis, Language
Models or Machine Translation. In the context of resource poor languages, these complex tools are all
the more important because of: <br>
1. Pivoting: translate a low resource language to resource rich language (like English) and use the
rich toolkit of resource rich language. <br>
2. As you look at complex applications at discourse or pragmatics level, you need reliable outputs
from these tools like sentiment analysis. <br>
3. Provide baselines. <br>
4. A shared knowledge repo for all implementations, allowing various teams to have look at the
existing work, tools available to them, evaluated by other teams. So that multiple teams do not
spend time in going through similar exercise.
